    "### Interpreted vs compiled languages\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between an interpreted and a compiled language lies in the result of the process of interpreting or compiling. An interpreter produces a result from a program, while a compiler produces a program written in assembly language. The assembler of architecture then turns the resulting program into binary code. Assembly language varies for each individual computer, depending upon its architecture. Consequently, compiled programs can only run on computers that have the same architecture as the computer on which they were compiled.\n",

    "### Pass by assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that arguments are passed by assignment in Python. Since assignment just creates references to objects, there’s no alias between an argument name in the caller and callee, and so no call-by-reference per se. You can achieve the desired effect in a number of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass a mutable object into a method, the method gets a reference to that same object and you can mutate it to your heart's delight, but if you rebind the reference in the method, the outer scope will know nothing about it, and after you're done, the outer reference will still point at the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass an immutable object to a method, you still can't rebind the outer reference, and you can't even mutate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Id \n",
    "\n",
    "This identity has to be unique and constant for this object during the lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value. If we relate this to C, then they are actually the memory address, here in Python it is the unique id. This function is generally used internally in Python.\n",

    "## Mutable vs immutable\n",

    "All immutable built-in objects in python are hashable. Mutable containers like lists and dictionaries are not hashable while immutable container tuple is hashable\n",

    "### What is a primary key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a unique key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Unique key constraint uniquely identified each record in the database. This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Primary key constraint has automatic unique constraint defined on it. But not, in the case of Unique Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be many unique constraint defined per table, but only one Primary key constraint defined per table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a foreign key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is one table which can be related to the primary key of another table. Relationship needs to be created between two tables by referencing foreign key with the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a constraint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraint can be used to specify the limit on the data type of table. Constraint can be specified while creating or altering the table statement. Sample of constraint are.\n",

    "\n",
    "UNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates duplicate rows from the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "MINUS/EXEPT operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. \n",
    "\n",
    "INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries."
